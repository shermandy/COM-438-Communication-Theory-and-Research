# A note on these study guides

These study guides are designed to help you begin to actively engage with the reading, rather than, you know, just reading it. The questions highlight some of the important concepts and ask you to considerthem in light of the whole chapter.Some questions are drawn directly from the text and others expect you to connect some dots.

**Do not write answers verbatim from the text.** This will not help you. Consider what the question is asking, what the text says, and then formulate an answer **in your own words**. Simply copying what the book says will not help you understand it.
