# Chapter 1 - A Scientific Approach to the Study of Media Effects
1.	What are the three primary methods of discovering media effects?
2.	What is the purpose of a content analysis?
3.	Why is a content analysis beneficial for study of media effects?
4.	What is the limitation of content analysis for study of media effects?
5.	What is Berelson's definition of content analysis?
6.	Define the differences between manifest and latent content.
7.	What is a population for a scientific study?
8.	What is a random sample and why is it important?
9.	What is a unit of analysis?
10.	What is a coding scheme?
11.	If more than one coder is involved, a study needs to have coding agreement. Why?
12.	What is the minimum acceptable coding reliability for content analysis?
13.	What purpose do surveys have in the study of media effects?
14.	Surveys are “an excellent way of exploring relationships between variables.” What does that mean?
15.	What is a cross-sectional survey?
16.	What is a longitudinal survey?
17.	What are the three types of longitudinal surveys?
18.	How are surveys used in a trend study?
19.	What is the difference between a cohort and a panel study?
20.	What is the challenge of long-term panel studies?
21.	In media effects, what is an example of a causal relationship?
22.	What are the three criteria needed for a researcher to establish a casual relationship?
23.	A researcher needs to establish two things are “empirically related.” What does that mean?
24.	What is the statistical formula used to determine if two variables are related? What is the statistical symbol for the results of this formula?
25.	What is a positive correlation? What is a negative correlation?
26.	A scatter plot with a positive correlation would go in which direction?
27.	What is the numerical range for correlation coefficients and what do the extremes represent?
28.	What does r = -.72 mean?
29.	What does it mean for a finding to be statistically significant? How is this represented numerically?
30.	What does it mean to determine the “time-order” of two variables? Why is this important for determining a casual relationship?
31.	What type of survey is needed to determine time-order of two variables?
32.	According to Guilford, “small but definite relationships” are coefficients ranging from...?
33.	According to Guilford, “moderate relationships” are coefficients ranging from...?
34.	By squaring the coefficient, researchers can determine how much variance in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable. This is called what?
35.	Why are surveys not capable of eliminating all third-variable explanations?
36.	How does the gathering of data from people differ in experiments compared to surveys?
37.	The variable thought to be the potential cause of another variable is called what?
38.	Why is random assignment and identical treatment important for experiments?
39.	In order to interpret the results of an experiment, it's important to include a...?
40.	When might a researcher opt for a post-test-only design?
41.	“The study examined American newspapers from July 23, 2012 (n = 438)...” What does “n” stand for?
42.	What are common criticisms about surveys? About experiments?
43.	 What is the difference between replication and convergence? Why are these two ideas important?
44.	What is the epidemiological approach? Why is it valuable? 
45.	What is a meta-analysis?
