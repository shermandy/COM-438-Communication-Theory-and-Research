## Notes
* Be prepared to compare and contrast each of the theoretical frameworks discussed this semester. You may be asked to compare to similar theories to two polar opposite theories. Know how the theories may affect your research decisions.
* Be prepared to explain how you would research a given issue. For example, “how would you study college students’ use of Instagram from the uses and gratifications perspective?” You should feel comfortable designing a research study using the various methodologies and theories covered this semester.
