# Final exam study guide
* Methodology – various types, what they are, when to use them, provide examples of possible studies
  * Content analysis
  * Experiments
  * Surveys
* Critical theory vs. functionalist theory - what is the goal of each, how studies in each function
*	Limited effects vs. hypodermic needle - history of each, examples of studies, theories, etc.
* Theoretical frameworks - compare and contrast, when to use, famous studies, connection to media research history
  * Selective exposure
  * Spiral of silence
  * Agenda-setting
  * Media cultivation
  * Uses and gratifications
  * Media ecology
  * Elaboration Likelihood Model
•	Research design - how to design a study, proper use of each item below
  * Selecting a methodology
  * Theoretical basis for the study
  * Sampling
  * Data collection methods
  * Independent variables vs. dependent variables
* Notable historical studies - impact on the field, impact on theory
  * Phases of communication research history
* Power of the audience - studies and theories that support it
* Power of the media - studies and theories that support it
* Changes in audience behavior - studies and theories that support the changes
## Notes
* Be prepared to compare and contrast each of the theoretical frameworks discussed this semester. You may be asked to compare to similar theories to two polar opposite theories. Know how the theories may affect your research decisions.
* Be prepared to explain how you would research a given issue. For example, “how would you study college students’ use of Instagram from the uses and gratifications perspective?” You should feel comfortable designing a research study using the various methodologies and theories covered this semester.
