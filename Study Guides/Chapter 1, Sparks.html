Why are falsifiable hypotheses important?</li>	<li>What does it mean for something to be generalized?</li>	<li>“Scientific research does more to inform us about broad general patterns across large groups of individuals than it does to help us understand the particulars of a given case.” What does this mean?</li>	<li>How does the concept of general patterns apply to the expectations that “everyday people” bring to science’s predictive or explanatory powers? Can science do what people think it can?</li>	<li>What is an objective truth? Why is it important?</li>	<li>What is meant by a “scientific attitude?” How do plausibility and the scientific method relate?</li>	<li>How does a scientific attitude approach claims made by individual studies?

Why or why not?</li>	<li>The chapter ends with types of questions science can't answer. Why can these not be answered?</li></ol>
