While you wait for your textbook to arrive, you can <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=vRSdBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q&f=false" target="blank">read this chapter online in the Google Books preview</a>.
1. What are benefits and drawbacks of the three “Ways of Knowing”?
2. Why does personal experience make for a poor means for “knowing” in the case of media effects?
3. What is authority? What are issues related to “knowing” by authority?
4. What is systematic observation?
5. How do the “Goals of Science” make science an effective “way of knowing”?
6. What is prediction and how does it apply to media effects?
7. What is explanation in terms of science and why is it important?
8. How do explanations in everyday life differ from explanations in the scientific method?
9. Scientific understanding means knowing the “causal sequence of events.” What does that mean?
10. What is needed to give “control” over a phenomenon?  How can the concept of control be applied to media studies?
11. What is most needed to achieve the goals of science?
12. What is the difference between a theory in everyday life and in science?
13. What are the three parts of scientific theory? What benefits do they bring?
14. What is a hypothesis?
15. How do hypotheses and theories relate?
16. What does it mean that a hypothesis must be falsifiable? Why are falsifiable hypotheses important?
17. What does it mean for something to be generalized?
18. “Scientific research does more to inform us about broad general patterns across large groups of individuals than it does to help us understand the particulars of a given case.” What does this mean?
19. How does the concept of general patterns apply to the expectations that “everyday people” bring to science’s predictive or explanatory powers? Can science do what people think it can?
20. What is an objective truth? Why is it important?
21. What is meant by a “scientific attitude?” How do plausibility and the scientific method relate?
22. How does a scientific attitude approach claims made by individual studies? Say, an experiment that says a product like Lumosity helps improve your brain function?
23. Does science deliver definitive conclusions? Why or why not?
24. The chapter ends with types of questions science can't answer. Why can these not be answered?
