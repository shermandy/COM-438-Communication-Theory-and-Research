20.	How did McLuhan view the decline in educational performance? How does his thinking view the exchange of information in a classroom?
21.	THINK: How might McLuhan view the ubiquity of interactive devices like iPads and smartphones on young children entering the classroom for the first time?
22.	What role does privacy place in the shift to the electronic age?
23.	THINK: How does the idea that young people attempt to “conform to the customs and habits of others like themselves” intersect with other media theories or approaches we've studied?
